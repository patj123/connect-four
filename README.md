# Connect 4 Game

This is a simple implementation of the Connect 4 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Player 1 and Player 2 alternate turns.
- On each turn, a piece is dropped down a column.
- The game ends when a player gets four-in-a-row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when the board is full (tie).
- The game board takes up the entire screen.
- Includes a falling animation for the pieces.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd connect4
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.

## Usage

- Click on the column tops to drop a piece into that column.
- Player 1 uses red pieces, and Player 2 uses blue pieces.
- The current player alternates after each move.
- The game checks for a win or tie after each move and displays an alert with the result.
